# `@bimo/core-utils-get-entity-class-key`

Helper functions to get an entity class key from another one or from an item.

Right now these functions are pretty simple and only access the constructor name or stuff like that. Still, its better to use these functions, in case the model or naming conventions evolve, and class keys become less obvious to retrieve from items or collections.
