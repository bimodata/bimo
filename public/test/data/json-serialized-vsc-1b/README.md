# `@bimo/test-data-json-serialized-vsc-1b`

This data set is an anonymized single vehicle schedule that contains trips and blocking data from a suburban rail line. It includes consist changes and maintenance operations.

Its primary use is in tests around computation of vehicle tasks.

The data is almost the same as in `@bimo/test-data-json-serialized-vsc-1` except here, a few blocks that are functionaly different have duplicate block numbers.
