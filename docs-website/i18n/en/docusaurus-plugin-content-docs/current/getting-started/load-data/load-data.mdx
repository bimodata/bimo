# Loading Data

As mentioned in the [introduction](../../intro/intro.mdx), Bimo's goal is to facilitate data processing from all sources through plugins. However, the plugins are not yet available as Open Source. (Feel free to contact us to discuss your needs - this could motivate us to accelerate the release of a specific plugin.)

With the modules published so far, it is possible to easily load data exported from HASTUS using a standard OIG. See [loading data from HASTUS](./from-hastus.mdx).

Another option is to put your data in JSON format, with a structure corresponding to the Bimo object model. See [loading JSON data](./from-json.mdx).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
